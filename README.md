# React Stock Portfolio App

A stock portfolio app in React with the following functionality:

- Calculate market value based on market price and shares owned
- Calculate unrealized gain/loss based on market value, cost per share, and shares owned
- Calculate the portfolio total market value, and unrealized gain/loss
- Delete a stock from the list
- Edit shares owned, cost per share, and market price
- Add a new stock to the portfolio

This is a project I am doing as part of my fullstack web development bootcamp with Altcademy (www.altcademy.com).
